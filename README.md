# The World's Simplest Chef Configuration

Use it with [Chef Solo](), like this:

  * Check out, or download and untar, into `/home/ubuntu/chef`.
  * Install Chef, by one means or another.
  * Run: `sudo chef-solo -c ~/chef/solo.rb`.

If you don't have a `/home/ubuntu`, perhaps because you're not running Ubuntu, 
you'll need to edit `solo.rb` to point to wherever you unzip this.

(I could make `solo.rb` more complicated to eliminate the
need for you to tinker with it, but that is not the point.
You should tinker with this until it works. It is a toy. Have fun and learn.)

## Why 'Reinheitsgebot'?

It's the [simpest recipe that could possibly work.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot) 
The results are surprisingly complex. Try

or if you don't need to get any more work done today,
